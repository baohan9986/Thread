# Thread

Thread is an interactive installation that tells a story of growth and transformation. Through a physical rope, participants guide a line as it evolves from a sapling to a tree and finally into a guitar, blending nature, creativity, and renewal.

## Story

A single red line starts with a sapling, which gradually grows into a towering tree. Once matured, it is cut down and carefully carved in a factory, eventually becoming a guitar. It traces not only the making of an instrument, but also the transformation of nature into human musical culture. 



## Interaction

- **User Input:** Pulling a physical rope  
- **System Feedback:** A red line evolves on screen  
- **Design Focus:** Intuitive interaction, no instructions needed â€” users control the pacing of the story  



## Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** String potentiometer, Arduino Nano  
- **Software:** p5.js, Arduino IDE
