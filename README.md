# Thread: An Interactive Installation

**Thread** is an interactive installation that tells a story of growth and transformation.  
Through a physical rope, participants guide a line as it evolves from a **sapling** to a **tree** and finally into a **guitar**, blending **nature, creativity, and renewal**.

---

## Story

- A single red line begins as a **sapling**, slowly growing into a towering **tree**.  
- Once matured, the tree is **cut down** and carefully **carved in a factory**.  
- Finally, it becomes a **guitar**, tracing not only the making of an instrument, but also the transformation of **nature into human musical culture**.
